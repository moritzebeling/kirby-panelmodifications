# Kirby Panel CSS Modifications

Adds CSS to Kirby panel to improve editor experience:
- Dialog boxes are wider
- All disabled (or non-translatable) fields are consistently grey
- Image backgrounds are almost white, but not fully white
- Same margins between fields and sections
- Button for changing the page title is visible
- Page status bullets are invisible if the page status canâ€™t be changed
- Page status bullets for unlisted pages are grey instead of violet blueish
- Some helpers for `sylvainjule/kirby-pagetable` plugin
- Preformatted text is actually written in mono

To compile SCSS, run:
```
sass --watch --style=compressed --no-source-map index.scss index.css
```
